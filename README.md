# ASTRO

ASTROCYTE 1.0. Interactive realistic model of protoplasmic astrocyte. NEURON environment

## version 1.0

Electrically non-excitable astrocytes are able to transduce, integrate and propagate physiological signals by engaging 
multi-modal fluctuations and non-dissipative diffusion waves of intracellular Ca2+. Deciphering this type of signalling, 
however, poses a conceptual challenge because it requires an understanding of molecular interactions in the complex 
system of ultrathin processes which constitute the bulk of astrocyte morphology. How a particular mode of intracellular 
Ca2+ signalling could generate a particular physiological message remains poorly understood. Gaining mechanistic insights 
into astrocytic physiology will be therefore difficult without a detailed biophysical model that recapitulates realistic 
astrocyte morphology and known cellular mechanisms.






## Installation. 

System Requirements for ASTRO:
•	The basic languages : C++, MATLAB older 2013 and Neuron 7.0
•	Platform : Linux and Windows. 
•	Type of operation : Sequential and parallel (MPI) computing


To work with Astro software the user needs to have Matlab and Neuron on the host computer, as well as Linux and NEURON on the remote computer. 


"Astro" contains four directories  "host" and "worker"  for installation ARACHNE in any cluster operating under Linux/Windows and any host computer 
operating under Windows with preinstalled Matlab. 

In the beginning the user must copy all the files from the Astro directory to his computer, keeping the structure of all the directories.
