# ASTRO

ASTROCYTE 1.0. Interactive realistic model of protoplasmic astrocyte. NEURON environment

## version 1.0

Electrically non-excitable astrocytes appear able in transducing, integrating and propagating physiological intracellular diffusion signals. Decrypting this type of signalling, however, poses a conceptual difficulty because it requires an understanding of molecular interactions in the massive morphological structure of nanoscale-thin leaf-like processes which constitute the bulk of ASTROCYTE geometry. How a particular cell signalling engages a precise type of geometry remains therefore poorly understood.
There have been no attempts to develop an ASTROCYTE model with such a spongy morphology even though this could provide the key to mechanistic insights into astrocytic physiology and Ca2+ signalling.
To understand the role of complex pattern in cell function we have adapted the NEURON modelling environment to build a simulation tool to produce different ASTROCYTE models with the detailed morphology, membrane properties and known molecular signalling mechanisms. The tool enables to design a distributed Ca2+ homoeostasis mechanisms including diffusion, wave propagation, gap-junction escape or channel currents whereas the simulation environment also has the capability to mimic uncaging, membrane physiology, volume current injections or fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments in the 3D tissue volume containing the astrocyte. 
To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to have a full-scale tool for astroglia simulations, which we believe will attract significant interest among a broad audience of cell biologists and neuroscientists.







## Installation. 

To work with Astro software the user needs to have Matlab and Neuron on the host computer, as well as Linux and NEURON on the remote computer. 


"Astro" contains four directories  "host" and "worker"  for installation ARACHNE in any cluster operating under Linux/Windows and any host computer operating under Windows with preinstalled Matlab. 

In the beginning the user must copy all the files from the Astro directory to his computer, keeping the structure of all the directories.
